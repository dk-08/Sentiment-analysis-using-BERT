# Sentiment-analysis-using-BERT
This project performs sentiment analysis on Trustpilot reviews using a pretrained BERT model (nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment). It scrapes real customer reviews, processes them with Hugging Face Transformers, and classifies sentiment on a 1â€“5 star scale for insight into customer feedback.
