# Sentiment Analysis on Trustpilot Reviews using BERT

This project uses a pretrained BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on real customer reviews scraped from [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/meesho.com). It classifies each review on a **1â€“5 star scale**, providing insight into customer satisfaction and feedback quality.

## ðŸš€ Features

* âœ… Scrapes reviews from Trustpilot (e.g., Meesho.com)
* âœ… Uses `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` model
* âœ… Classifies sentiment from 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive) stars
* âœ… Handles multilingual and informal text
* âœ… Outputs results to a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Install required libraries with:

```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas beautifulsoup4 requests
```

> You may also need `selenium` if scraping JavaScript-heavy pages.

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. **Scrape reviews** from Trustpilot using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`.
2. **Clean and tokenize** text using Hugging Face's tokenizer.
3. **Run predictions** through a pretrained BERT model.
4. **Map logits** to sentiment labels (1â€“5 stars).
5. **Visualize or export** sentiment scores for analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

```text
Review: "The product was decent but arrived late."
Predicted: 3â˜… (Neutral)
```
